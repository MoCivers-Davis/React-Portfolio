# Mo Civers-Davis React Portfolio

## Description
The motivation for creating this project is two-fold.  Initially, this project provided an opportunity to display my coding skills while they continued to evolve.  As my skillsets developed I realized that not only is this an opportunity to display my skills but it is also an opportunity to better network within the tech industry.  

I am a newbie to an ever expanding industry that changes at what seems like the speed of light as new technologies and higher level langauages are introduced.  This project afords a unique  opportunity for me to present work that I've done, collaborate with others within the community of interest, and ultimately network up within the industry.  

Prior to this project, I had no respectful portfolio to present or the coding skills to develop any code to present.  Since starting the project I have learned Unix commands, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, VS Code, Slack, Git Hub, GitLab, and Stack Overflow. We are now beginning to learn JavaScript.

As you review this project you will learn a little about me, my journey on the path to becoming a software devloper and some of my code from previous work.  You will also have an opportunity to reach out to me on the contacts page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
